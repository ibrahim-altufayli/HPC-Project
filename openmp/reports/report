Intel(R) Advisor can now assist with vectorization and show optimization
  report messages with your source code.
See "https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-advisor-xe" for details.


Begin optimization report for: main(int, char **)

    Report from: Vector optimizations [vec]


LOOP BEGIN at ./code/mandelbrot.cpp(174,9)
   remark #15523: loop was not vectorized: loop control variable col was found, but loop iteration count cannot be computed before executing the loop
LOOP END

LOOP BEGIN at ./code/mandelbrot.cpp(121,17)
   remark #15521: loop was not vectorized: loop control variable was not identified. Explicitly compute the iteration count before executing the loop or try using canonical loop form from OpenMP specification

   LOOP BEGIN at ./code/mandelbrot.cpp(113,5)
      remark #15344: loop was not vectorized: vector dependence prevents vectorization. First dependence is shown below. Use level 5 report for details
      remark #15346: vector dependence: assumed OUTPUT dependence between call:std::operator<<<std::char_traits<char>>(std::basic_ostream< (119:30) and call:?1memset (127:34)

      LOOP BEGIN at ./code/mandelbrot.cpp(115,9)
         remark #15344: loop was not vectorized: vector dependence prevents vectorization. First dependence is shown below. Use level 5 report for details

         LOOP BEGIN at ./code/mandelbrot.cpp(128,17)
            remark #15520: loop was not vectorized: loop with multiple exits cannot be vectorized unless it meets search loop idiom criteria   [ ./code/mandelbrot.cpp(133,21) ]
         LOOP END
      LOOP END
   LOOP END
LOOP END


Non-optimizable loops:


LOOP BEGIN at ./code/mandelbrot.cpp(172,5)
   remark #15333: loop was not vectorized: exception handling for a call prevents vectorization   [ ./code/mandelbrot.cpp(176,24) ]
LOOP END

Begin optimization report for: calc_rmse(int *, std::string *)

    Report from: Vector optimizations [vec]


LOOP BEGIN at ./code/mandelbrot.cpp(32,9)
   remark #15523: loop was not vectorized: loop control variable pxlCol was found, but loop iteration count cannot be computed before executing the loop
LOOP END


Non-optimizable loops:


LOOP BEGIN at /usr/include/c++/4.8.5/bits/basic_string.h(539,54) inlined into ./code/mandelbrot.cpp(52,5)
   remark #15333: loop was not vectorized: exception handling for a call prevents vectorization   [ /usr/include/c++/4.8.5/bits/locale_facets.h(869,8) ]
